## About

ZGallery is lightweight, fast gallery based in pure Javascript+Ð¡SS3. Plugin **doesn't need for Jquery** or other similar framework.

Plugin consists from one JS file size **9 kb**, one CSS file size **2 kb**, and icons size **3** kb. He is really small. Your page will load instantly!

## Basic usage

* Create new folder for your project. Copy there **js**, **css**, **img** folders, then create basic HTML file in the root project directory with next markup:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>ZGallery work test</title>
  <meta charset='utf-8'>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

* Inside ```<head>``` tag include zGallery JS file

```html
<script src='js/zgallery.min.js'></script>
```

* Create div inside ```<body>``` tag with images

```html
<div id='my-gallery'>
  <img src="image1.jpg"  alt=''>
  <img src="image2.jpg" alt=''>
</div>
```


* Init zGallery, using event **DOMContentLoaded**, pass to the function ID of element with images *(by example my-gallery)*

```html
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
  zGallery.init('my-gallery');
});
```
* That's all! ;)

### Advanced usage

You can pass in a function your options to change the functional of zGallery.

### Plugin options

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
  var options = {
      //height of thumbnails
      previewHeight: 50,
      //Color of image wrapper
      background: '#000',
      //Enable preload images?
      autoPreload: true,
      //The key which will be added to the image ID
      prefix: 'zg-img',
      //Enable animations?
      animation: true,
      //Start slideshow immediately, after clicks by thumbnail
      slideshow: false,
      //Language of gallery menu
      lang: 'eng',
      //Path to the css file, this parameter needed if you use plugin in subdirectory
      cssPath: 'css/zg-style.min.css',
      //Enable async stylesheet load
      loadCssAsync: true
  };
  
  zGallery.init('my-gallery', options);
});

### Several galleries on page

You can create as many galleries as you need. You can do so:

Pattern: First parametr - *element(s)*, second - *options* for this element(s) and etc.

```JS
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
 var options = {
  previewHeight: 100,
  autoPreload: false
 };
 
 zGallery.init('my-gallery1, mygallery2', options, 'my-gallery3, my-gallery4', 'my-gallery5, my-gallery6, mygallery7');
});
```

### Use mouse and keyboard

**Keyboard control:**

* Right arrow - show next image
* Left arrow - show previous image
* Up arrow - show first image
* Down arrow - show last image
* Esc - close image gallery
* Enter - toggle fullscreen

**Mouse control:**

* Click on the right side of the screen - to show the next image
* Click on the left side of the screen - to show the previous image
* Using the mouse and gallery menu you can repeat the functionality of the keyboard

This is my first project at github so do not judge strictly. Thant you :)
